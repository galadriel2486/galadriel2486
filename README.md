# **Hello! ðŸª´**
I'm a brazilian data analyst passionate about numbers, information... anything that can bring me some insights. Although being in the fourth semester of my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I usually say that what I learned about data was in my personal and professional incursions. I am very self-taught.
